## About This Project

This repository contains the **Indian startup ecosystem analysis** project: datasets, Jupyter notebooks, and visualizations for understanding **startup growth**, **funding dynamics**, **market valuation**, and **geographical distribution** of Indian startups. The analysis explores trends, sector dominance, and the link between funding and success in India's startup ecosystem.

India has emerged as a major global startup hub. This project offers a clear, data-backed view of that landscape—useful for researchers, students, and anyone interested in **Indian startups**, **startup data analysis**, or **Python data science** workflows.

## What You'll Find

| Item | Location | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Notebook** | `Project.ipynb` | Full analysis: data prep, EDA, and visualizations |
| **Data** | `datasets/` | Indian startups dataset (CSV & Excel) |
| **Charts** | `visualizations/` | Maps, growth curves, sector breakdowns, and more |
| **Docs** | Root | Code Documentation PDF, Project Report PDF |

---

## Dataset

The analysis uses an **Indian startups dataset** in the [`datasets/`](./datasets) folder:

- **Files:** `Project Data.csv`, `Project Data.xlsx`
- **Contents:** Startup name, state, city, start year, founder(s), industry, number of employees, funding (USD), funding rounds, number of investors, market valuation (USD)

Use the `datasets/` folder for raw data; the notebook shows how it is loaded and cleaned.

---

## Visualizations

The [`visualizations/`](./visualizations) folder includes charts and maps from the analysis, such as:

- **Geography:** Startup distribution by state and city (e.g., top 5 cities, North vs South, state-wise)
- **Valuation & growth:** Highest market valuation, growth of startups, valuation by industry
- **Funding:** Most/least funding, funding per employee, rounds vs funding
- **Sectors:** Most common industries (national and state-level, e.g., Karnataka, Haryana), top valuation industries
- **Other:** Founders vs valuation, average employees, word cloud

Open the folder or the notebook to view and reuse these visuals.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python** — Core language for analysis and scripting
- **Pandas** — Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation
- **NumPy** — Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** — Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** — Interactive analysis and reporting

---

## Key Insights

The analysis highlights:

- **Geographical concentration** — Major startup hubs and regional patterns (North vs South, state-wise)
- **Valuation trends** — How startup valuations evolve; billion-dollar companies and industries
- **Sector performance** — Leading industries and their share of funding/valuation
- **Funding dynamics** — Relationship between funding rounds, investor count, and success metrics

For a narrative summary and discussion, see the project report PDF and the notebook’s markdown sections.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KuchikiRenji/Startup-Growth-Analysis.git
   cd Startup-Growth-Analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (Python 3, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, openpyxl for Excel)
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openpyxl jupyter
   ```

3. **Run the analysis**
   - Open `Project.ipynb` in Jupyter and run all cells, or
   - Ensure `Project Data.xlsx` is in the path used by the notebook (e.g. same directory or `datasets/` as in the notebook).

4. **Explore** — Check `datasets/` and `visualizations/` for data and outputs.
